# Data-Mining-on-Fuel-Price-Trends-in-Malaysia
uel Price Prediction using Data Mining Techniques

Overview
This project leverages data mining techniques to analyze and predict fuel price trends in Malaysia. Using historical data of RON95, RON97, Diesel, and Diesel (East Malaysia) prices, the study employs machine learning models to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights. The models are evaluated on metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²).

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends, distributions, and correlations in fuel prices.
Predictive Modeling: Implements Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model parameters using Grid Search and cross-validation.
Performance Evaluation: Compares models using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics.

Dataset
The dataset contains 767 rows and 6 columns:
Date: Date of price recording.
Series Type: Type of data classification.
RON95: Price of RON95 fuel (MYR per liter).
RON97: Price of RON97 fuel (MYR per liter).
Diesel: Price of Diesel (MYR per liter).
Diesel East Malaysia: Price of Diesel in East Malaysia (MYR per liter).

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for model implementation and hyperparameter tuning.
XGBoost for Gradient Boosting.
Environment: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
